# Building_blocks_mobile

Building Blocks Mobile App is the last project for CraftAcademy Cohort (Feb-April 2017). This is the app for housing community that will allow tenants to send help message request, book a facility using their mobile phone, be updated with the latest events/news in their community.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for deployment and testing purposes.  See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

In order to organize the features needed for our project and track our progress, we used different tools such as:

**Pivotal Tracker**
[Pivotal Tracker for Building blocks](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2007795).

**GitHub**
[GitHub Pages](https://github.com/casperjureskog/ionic2-port.git
.
